# 🍕 Max
Project Max is a robot that can do any action depending on its own movements. Because of its programming and your smartphone, this is feasible. Despite the fact that it seems ridiculous, Max is being built! All Max scripts (in C++) are contained in this repository.

# 🤖 Arduino-based
Max is being built with Arduino (C++), and covers several other technologies.

# 🔥 From Brazil to the World
Max is being created by just one person, Yan (CEO/Founder of SwankyNoob). The Brazilian Yan, or also known as Wesley Yan Soares Brehmer, started this project when he was only 14 years old, and never stopped, even though it seemed impossible to build something like this.
