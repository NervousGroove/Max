# 🍕 Max
Project Max, is a robot capable of making any movement, based on its movements. This is possible, because of its programming, and your smartphone. It sounds like a crazy idea, but Max is under construction! In this repository are all Max scripts (in C++).

# 🤖 Arduino-based
Max is being built with Arduino (C++), and covers several other technologies.

# 🔥 From Brazil to the World
Max is being created by just one person, Yan (CEO/Founder of SwankyNoob). The Brazilian Yan, or also known as Wesley Yan Soares Brehmer, started this project when he was only 14 years old, and never stopped, even though it seemed impossible to build something like this.
